This mod adds new rules to commanders:
1) Every starting territory can start with a commander.
2) Commanders can be limited in their movement. Both transfering and attacking can be forbidden. Note that if a forbidden move is made, the order is cancelled and all armies remain on the territory.
3) Reconnaisance cards can spawn a new commander when played on your own territory.
4) When for a territory there is no path between it and a commander at the end of a turn, it becomes neutral.

"Can" means that this possiblity can be turned off.
(It is not posssible to change the value of a commander and if it dies you still lose the game. There is no workaround to solve this)
