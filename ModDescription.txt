This mod adds new rules to commanders:
1) Every starting territory can start with a commander.
2) Commanders are only allowed to transfer, but you can also disallow that which causes them to stay at their spot or allow them to be able to attack.
3) Reconnaisance cards can spawn a new commander when played on your own territory.
4) When for a territory there is no path between it and a commander at the end of a turn, it becomes neutral.

"Can" means that this possiblity can be turned off.
(It is not posssible to change the value of a commander and if it dies you still lose the game. There is no workaround to solve this)
